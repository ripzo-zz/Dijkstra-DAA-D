 Rules for solving the puzzle.
Instead of moving the tiles in the empty space we can visualize moving the empty space in place of the
tile, basically swapping the tile with the empty space. The empty space can only move in four directions
viz.,
1. Up
2. Down
3. Right or
4. Left.

The empty space cannot move diagonally and can take only one step at a time (i.e. move the empty
space one position at a time).
